# data-structures-binary-tree-food
Higher Diploma in Computing, Software Development, Data Structures module. 
This project was created as an end-of-semester exam with binary trees in Java, using generics.
The projects defines a comparable Food Object Name, that contains Price, Healthy Eating Index (integer assigned between the range of 0-
10, with healthier items closer to 0). Comparison of Food Product Objects should use the Healthy Eating Index.
An interface for a Binary Tree is created that ensures that only trees of comparable objects can be constructed.
Methods to implement:

isEmpty, checks if tree contains no nodes
add, inserts new node into the tree
size, counts the number of nodes in the tree
minEmission, finds the minimum CO2 emission car
maxEmission, finds the maximum CO2 emission car
inOrder, a tree traversal method, prints the nodes in ascending order.
